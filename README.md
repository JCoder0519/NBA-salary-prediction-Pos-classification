Roadmap for NBA Player Salary Prediction and Position Classification Project
1. Project Planning and Setup
Define Objectives: Identify the main goals: predicting NBA player salaries and classifying player positions.
Environment Setup: Install necessary Python libraries: Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, gunicorn, and others. Set up Heroku for deployment.
2. Data Collection
Data Sources: Collect player statistics from sources like nba.com, basketball-reference.com, and NBA API.
Data Scraping: Use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data and ensure it is up-to-date.
3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for both salary prediction and position classification.
Normalization: Scale features for better model performance.
4. Model Development
Position Classification:
Model Selection: Use logistic regression.
Training: Train the model on historical player statistics.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Salary Prediction:
Model Selection: Use regression models.
Training: Train the model on player statistics and salary data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
5. Model Optimization
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search for optimal hyperparameters.
Cross-validation: Ensure the modelâ€™s generalizability by performing cross-validation.
6. Web Application Development
Flask Setup: Develop a Flask web application to serve the models.
Endpoints: Create API endpoints for predicting player positions and salaries.
User Interface: Develop a simple UI for users to input player statistics and get predictions.
7. Deployment
Prepare for Deployment: Ensure the application runs smoothly locally.
Heroku Deployment: Deploy the Flask application on Heroku.
Environment Configuration: Set up necessary environment variables and dependencies on Heroku.
8. Testing and Validation
Unit Testing: Write tests for different parts of the application to ensure everything works as expected.
Integration Testing: Test the entire workflow from data input to prediction output.
9. Documentation
Technical Documentation: Document the code, libraries used, and the setup process.
User Guide: Create a guide for end-users on how to use the application.
10. Monitoring and Maintenance
Monitoring: Set up monitoring to track application performance and errors.
Regular Updates: Update models and data regularly to maintain prediction accuracy.
